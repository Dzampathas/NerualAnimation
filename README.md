# Neural Animation Cleanup

## Summery

  In the animation industry we spend so long trying to get finalize and clean up animation. I'm curious to explore what neural networks can do for the medium and how the process could be simplified or automated. Using an implementation of Neural Style in Tensor Flow https://github.com/anishathalye/neural-style to simplify the animation rendering/ clean up process. 
  
  Whether this means an animator could do less work cleaning up their drawings, or if modelers and riggers could have less detailed and intricate models.It would be time saving to have a system that could remove the grunt work. Using primate Models, or rough sketches to have the clean up be finalized by a neural network might make animation even more accessible than ever.


## Challenges

  First and foremost I have to figure out what limitations Neural Style may have and what I can actually accomplish with the precompiled tools. -- This step will inform more challenges to come, and whether or not I may have to edit the source code...
  
  Secondly I have to discover how I can cater to the training data and what I can get away with in the data set.
  
  Finally I would have to create or gather some assets to experiment with.
  
## Timeline

#### Week 1
  Experiment with Neural Style and Discover limitations.
#### Week 2
  Proceed with knowledge of limitation. Make edits, or find other sources of code.
#### Week 3
  Neural Net refinements. 
#### Week 4
  2D Animation assets and tests.
#### Week 5
  3D Animation assets and test.
